# Flight App

## Project Description

Welcome to the Flight App. 

Want to see the assessment without having to download and install? [(Flight App)](https://flight-app.jackashton.dev/)

The Flight App is a project I created for a coding test which revolves around creating an API to provide access to a dataset containing two weeks of real flight information. The app aims to perform basic analysis on the retrieved data and answer the following questions:

*	How many of the flights depart in the morning (before 12 PM)? 
*	What percentage of the total set of flights fly into Sweden? 
*	What are the 10 most popular destination airports? 
*	What’s the average journey time between London Heathrow (LHR) and Dubai (DXB)?
*	What are the 10 cheapest flights (converted to £)?

The initial set of four questions constituted the core tasks assigned, while the fifth question was introduced as a captivating metric. It was selected due to the importance of price assessment in the evaluation of any commodity.
Finally, the web application presents the data in an easy to follow way.
